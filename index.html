    <!--Headings Are Important
    
        Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

        Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to
        show the document structure.

        h1 headings should be usedd for main headins, followed by h2
        headings, then the less important h3, and so on.

        Note, use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make 
        text BIG or bold.
    -->

    <!--Bigger Headings
    
        Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for 
        any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property
    -->
   <h1 style="font-size: 60px;">Heading 1</h1>
